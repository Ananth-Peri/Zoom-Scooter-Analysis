# Zoom-Scooter-Analysis
The project titled "Zoom Scooter Sales Analysis" focuses on analyzing the sales decline of a new two-wheeler model, Sprint, launched by Zoom Electric (ZE) - part of Zoom Motors India Private Limited. 
Despite initial strong sales, there was a notable drop after the first two weeks. The implications of this decline could seriously impact the company's revenues. The objectives were to:

Determine if the launch date affected sales growth by comparing the Sprint's growth rate to another model, the Sprint Limited, launched on a different date.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the email marketing campaign in influencing purchases by comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as email opening and click rates against industry benchmarks.

The approach involved extracting data for both Sprint and Sprint Limited from the given datasets, calculating cumulative 7-day sales for both, and then performing a comparative analysis. 
Additionally, the project analyzed the email campaign data to calculate KPIs.Findings indicated a true relationship between the launch date and sales growth. 
However, while the email opening rate was slightly above industry standards, the click rate was significantly below.
